## Media-controls
Makes it easier to control media playing software, such as spotify or youtube in a browser, without dedicated buttons on the keyboard. 

Shift+F1 Pauses/unpauses

Shift+F2 Stops the playback

Shift+F3 Jumps to the previous track

Shift+F4 Jumps to the next track

## Missing buttons
I usually use an american layout on my physical keyboard, but the swedish layout inside windows. This means im missing a couple of keys. <, > and | to be specific. 

With this script you can use these anyway: 

WIN = Windowskey(start menu)

WIN+Z : <

WIN+X : >

WIN+C : |
